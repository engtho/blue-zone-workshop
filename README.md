# Blue Zone - Event-Driven Microservices Workshop

Learn modern microservices architecture with **Apache Kafka**, **Spring Boot**, **Kotlin**, and **React** by building a simplified telecom incident management system.

## üéì Learning Objectives

After completing this workshop, you'll have a better understanding of:

- **Event-Driven Architecture** with Apache Kafka
- **Microservices Communication** patterns
- **REST API Design** and implementation
- **Asynchronous Processing** and message queues
- **Spring Boot & Kotlin** for backend development
- **React & TypeScript** for frontend development
- **Docker Compose** for local development

---
## üéØ What You'll Build

A complete event-driven microservices system that handles telecom network incidents from detection to resolution. You'll learn how distributed systems communicate through events and REST APIs.

**What Each Service Does:**

- **üö® Alarm Service**: Simulates network outages, publishes incident events to Kafka
- **üé´ Ticket Service**: Automatically creates support tickets from alarm events, manages ticket lifecycle
- **üë• Customer Service**: Stores customer data
- **üìß Notification Service**: Processes events and sends notifications to affected customers
- **üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Dashboard**: React-based UI for monitoring incidents and managing tickets

### Event Flow
1. Network alarm occurs ‚Üí Alarm Service publishes event
2. Ticket Service consumes alarm event ‚Üí Creates support ticket  
3. Ticket Service publishes ticket created event
4. Notification Service consumes ticket event ‚Üí Sends customer notifications
5. Frontend displays real-time updates

## Required Software

### üì¶ Installation Guide

### Windows Setup

**1. Install Docker Desktop**
```powershell
# Option 1: Download installer
# Visit: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows/
# Download and run Docker Desktop Installer.exe

# Option 2: Using Windows Package Manager
winget install Docker.DockerDesktop

# No need to create a docker account

# Enable WSL2 (if prompted)
```

**2. Install Git**
```powershell
# Download from official site
# Visit: https://git-scm.com/download/win

# Or using winget
winget install Git.Git
```

**3. Verify Installation**
```powershell
docker --version
git --version
```

### macOS Setup

You can use homebrew to install Docker Desktop and Git. To install homebrew check out https://brew.sh/

**1. Install Docker Desktop**
```bash
# Option 1: Download from official site
# Visit: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac/
# Choose the right version for your chip (Intel/Apple Silicon)

# Option 2: Using Homebrew
brew install --cask docker

# No need to create a docker account
```

**2. Install Git (usually pre-installed)**
```bash
# Check if already installed
git --version

# If not installed, use Homebrew
brew install git
```

**3. Verify Installation**
```bash
docker --version
git --version
```

### Start Docker Desktop
- **Windows**: Search for "Docker Desktop" in Start Menu
- **macOS**: Open Docker from Applications folder
- Wait for Docker to start (whale icon in system tray should be stable)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/engtho/blue-zone-workshop.git

# Then make sure you cd into the cloned repository
cd blue-zone-workshop
```

### 2. Start All Services
```bash
# Build and start all microservices with Kafka
# It can take some time to build and run it the first time
docker compose up --build

# This will start:
# - Kafka & Zookeeper (message broker)
# - 4 Spring Boot microservices  
# - React frontend
# - Kafka UI for monitoring
```

### 3. Wait for Services to Start
```bash
# Check status (all should show "healthy" or "running")
docker compose ps

# Services typically take 1-2 minutes to fully start
```

### 4. Access the Applications

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| **Frontend Dashboard** | http://localhost:3000 | Main application UI |
| **Kafka UI** | http://localhost:8081 | Monitor Kafka topics/messages |

### 5. Verify Everything Works
1. Open the frontend at http://localhost:3000
2. Verify that you can see three tickets to the right
3. Click "Create Alarm" to simulate a network incident
4. Verify that a green box with "Alarm created successfully!" is shown
5. Verify that you can access http://localhost:8081

You are now ready for the workshop and can stop the services with:
```bash
docker compose down
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Docker Issues

**üî¥ "Port already in use" errors**
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :3000  # macOS
netstat -ano | findstr :3000  # Windows

# Stop conflicting services
```

### Application Issues

**üî¥ Services not starting properly**
```bash
# Check logs for specific service
docker compose logs <service-name>
# E.g. 
docker compose logs ticket-service  

```

**üî¥ "Connection refused" errors**
```bash
# Wait longer - services need time to initialize
# Check if all containers are running
docker compose ps

# Full restart if needed
docker compose down
docker compose up --build -d
```

**üî¥ Debugging a specific service** 
```bash
# View real-time logs 
docker compose logs -f <service-name>
# E.g. 
docker compose logs -f ticket-service
```

### Performance Issues

**üî¥ Slow startup times**
- Allocate more RAM to Docker Desktop (8GB recommended)
- Close other memory-intensive applications

## üÜò Getting Help

If you're stuck:

1. **Check the troubleshooting section** above
2. **Review service logs**: `docker compose logs <service-name>`
3. **Verify all services are running**: `docker compose ps`
4. **Try a clean restart**: `docker compose down && docker compose up --build`
5. **If all else fails, create an issue on the [github page](https://github.com/engtho/blue-zone-workshop/issues/new)**

Tasks will be given at the workshop!
Happy coding! üöÄ
